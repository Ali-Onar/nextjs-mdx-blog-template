| **Speed**            | Slower execution              | Instant order execution        |
| **Emotion Control**  | High emotional involvement    | Removes emotional decision-making |
| **24/7 Operation**   | Limited by human availability | Operates continuously          |
| **Backtesting**      | Difficult to perform           | Easily backtest strategies      |
